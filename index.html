    <h3>Welcome to Lightshow RUSH!</h3><br>
    <a>This game has a few twists and turns. You have to click balls and there's many balls, +1, fast ball, x2, you name it! You can also participate in missions where you have to complete goals, some of them are hidden so you'll have to play to unlock missions! With missions, you can also unlock mini-games! Think of mini-games in Plants Vs. Zombies, like that but Lightshow RUSH!</a><br>
    <a>If you're new, check out the tutorial, you'll learn a lot! We hope you enjoy Lightshow RUSH!</a><br>
